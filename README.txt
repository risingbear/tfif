🌀 TFIF – Tobias Fractal Intelligence Framework
Post-Quantum Symbolic Engine for Recursive AI, Energy Systems & Cognitive Compression

This repository contains the core modules and prototypes for the TFIF Framework, developed by Bjørn Marius Bråthen / Rising Bear AS | +47 410 88 800 - bmbraa@gmail.com. TFIF is a symbolic-computational architecture that:

🔁 Performs fractal recursion via R(P, n) trees

🔺 Encodes symbolic intelligence into modular .py processors

♨️ Maps thermal logic to computation via E = IV / C (TFIF-Kelvin)

🧠 Powers AI cognition, memory compression, and error correction

🎨 Includes a fractal visual engine (UFA) for Mandelbrot-style symbolic rendering

👁 Supports recursive observer modeling via RWG (Recursive Witness Geometry)

🚫 Enforces ethical utility (U > 0.1) and harmonic resonance (369 logic gates)
